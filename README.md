## Introduction
Crude oil is one of the most traded commodities globally, valued for its relative security and fundamental role in modern society. However, despite its perceived stability, the oil market has experienced significant price drops during events such as the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 oil crash. While many market participants faced substantial losses during these periods, firms like Gunvor Group and Trafigura capitalized on the opportunity by leveraging a contango market structure.
This project explores the trends and key metrics leading up to these market crashes and assesses the performance of a random forest machine learning model designed to predict the type of market structure—such as contango or backwardation—in the oil market.

## Methodology
The data in this model was collected from the U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA) focusing on the spot price FOB of WTI crude oil price in $/BBL, as well as NYMEX future contracts for crude oil. Below is a screenshot of the excel sheet of the data I worked with.
